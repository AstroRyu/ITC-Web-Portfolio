          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>I have a deep passion for ancient Roman history, especially the fascinating periods of the late republic and early empire. I find it intriguing to explore not only the political and military developments of that era but also their societal attitudes, including the racism and stereotypes that shaped their culture. When I'm not diving into history, I enjoy unwinding with games like Valorant and League of Legends. Whether it's strategizing in intense matches or immersing myself in the gaming community, these activities bring me excitement and a way to connect with others.</p>

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>My main goal is to become a successful software developer, constantly improving my skills and staying ahead in the ever-evolving tech industry. I aim to build innovative, user-friendly software that can make a real impact. Alongside my professional aspirations, I also have a personal goal to marry the love of my life, Faye. Our journey together means the world to me, and I look forward to building a future filled with love, happiness, and shared dreams.</p>
